This game consists of a 2D platformer game where the main objective is to get as many cherries as you can and to pass all obstacles and enemies to arrive at the house located at the end of the map.

## First ideas
The tutorial explains how to do that in Unity, but there are some things that need to be added to the game (new features):
- Exit Game: An option to allow players to exit the game from the main menu.
- Level Selection: Create a menu for players to choose different levels.
- Volume Options: An option to adjust the volume, including music and sound effects.
- Double jump: In the 8th video where jumping is explained, he only explains how to
make a simple jump, but that can be improved by implementing a double jump.
- Sprint: In the 7th video, it also explains basic movements, and doing something
similar to a sprint can improve the game mobility.
- Character change: Adding an option where you can select the character you want to
play with. Each character will have unique abilities, like moving faster or jumping
higher.
- Background change: In the tutorial he is using the same background all the time,
but more background options can be introduced.
- Levels difficulty: When creating different levels, each one to be harder than the one
played before.
- Two players mode: Having the option to select either if you want to play alone or
with another player.
- Checkpoints: Put some checkpoints around the map, not to start from scratch when
dying.

## Used ideas
- Exit Game: There is an option in the main menu to exit the game.
- Level Selection: Create a menu for players to choose different levels.
- Volume Options: There is an option to adjust the volume in the options part or when clicking Esc while playing.
- Double jump and Sprint: The double jump and sprints weren't added as they doesn't match the game logic (instead of that, there is a powerup that gives the player more speed and jumps higher).
- Character change: There is no option to change the character.
- Background change: This is changed depending on the level you are.
- Levels difficulty: The difficulty to get all the cherries increases when you go further.
- Two players mode: This wasn't added as I see no sense putting a two players mode on this type of game.
- Checkpoints: These are the home located at the final of the level. (If player lose all the lives he has to start from scratch)
- Best score: This was added for the user to know what is the highest score of the game.
